## How to install
Download or clone the repository to a directory of your choice.

From the stream-outlier-comparison directory run the installMDC.sh script to download the dependencies needed.

## Reproduce experiments

**Creating datasets**

1. Open MATLAB
2. Include the folders containing MDCGen and MDCStream in the MATLAB path (with subfolders).
3. In the MATLAB environment, go to [mdcstream-wrapper]
4. To generate the used datasets, run: 
> experiments_Sep2019

Datasets are stored in [mdcstream-wrapper/dataRoot]


**Executing MOA stream out-det algorithms**

1. Go to [moa-wrapper]
2. From the terminal, execute:
> java -jar outlier-detector.jar config.xml
    
By default, results are stored in [mdcstream-wrapper/results]
    
The previous command tests all algorithms together with all datasets. To obtain results and time performances separately, use instead:
> time java -jar outlier-detector.jar config????.xml 

where "????" stands for the specific algorithm ("MCOD", "SimpleCOD", "AbstractC", "ExactStorm", and "AproxStorm")

**Calculating performances**

1. Go to [py_metrics]
2. From the terminal, execute: 
> python3 extract_performances.py
